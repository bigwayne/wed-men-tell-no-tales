# Single Page Application (SPA) Wedding Site

## What Changed?

Your wedding site is now a **Single Page Application (SPA)**. This means:

âœ… **Music plays continuously** when navigating between pages - no interruptions!
âœ… Smooth fade transitions between pages
âœ… Faster page loads (content swaps instead of full page reload)
âœ… All features work exactly the same (RSVP form, carousels, modals, translations)
âœ… Browser back/forward buttons work perfectly
âœ… Users can still bookmark specific pages (index.html, rsvp.html, etc.)

## How It Works

**Before (Multi-Page):**
- Clicking a link â†’ Browser loads new HTML file â†’ Music stops â†’ Music tries to restart

**Now (SPA):**
- Clicking a link â†’ JavaScript swaps content â†’ Music keeps playing! ðŸŽµ

## Files

- **index.html** - Main file with all page templates
- **spa-app.js** - Handles page navigation and feature initialization
- **language.js** - Language translations (unchanged)
- **scripts.js** - Original scripts (unchanged)
- **wedding-styles.css** - Styles (unchanged)

## Backups

Your original files are backed up in:
- `backup/` folder - Original HTML files
- `index-old-backup.html` - Previous index.html

## Deployment

Just push to GitHub Pages as normal! Everything works the same way, but now with continuous music playback.

## Technical Details

The SPA uses:
- HTML `<template>` tags to store page content
- JavaScript to clone and inject template content
- History API for URL management
- Event delegation for navigation
- Smooth CSS transitions for page changes

All page-specific features (RSVP form, carousels, image modals) are re-initialized automatically when pages change.
